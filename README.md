# Trajectory Optimization for Multicopter UAV Lateral Flight
Trajectory optimization for multicopter UAV lateral flight demonstrated for flip maneuver during vertical and horizontal displacements. This code sets up and solves a nonlinear program (NLP) using the CasADi software toolbox. More details about the implementation formulation are given in the **Time-optimal trajectory planning for multicopter lateral flight.pdf** file, which provides a comparison of the proposed solution with the one shown in [1], by using the code provided in the Electronic Supplementary Material section in [this link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-012-9282-3#Sec37).

## Setup for CasADi in Matlab for Windows
Download CasADi binaries from [this link](https://web.casadi.org/get/), unzip the files and place them in a directory of your choice. Then, in Matlab, run the following command depending on the file you downloaded.
```
addpath('<yourpath>/casadi-3.6.6)
```
In order to run this command each time Matlab starts, run
```
open startup.m
```
and paste `addpath('<yourpath>/casadi-3.6.6)` in the *startup.m* file.

## Demonstration Video

The Youtube video in this link (to be updated...) shows the results of each of the main files. The slides used for the video are shown in the **Time-optimal trajectory planning for multicopter lateral flight_Presentation.pdf** file. (to be added...)
